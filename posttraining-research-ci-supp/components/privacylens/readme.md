## Analysis and experiments on PrivacyLens dataset 


### Extracting domains, topics, entities
- Ran GPT to extract information about sender, receiver, subject from each example (verified the result on a few examples and they seem reasonable) 
- `privacylens_data_analysis.json` contains `example` (the dataset item), `full_analysis` (GPT output), and `short` (the itemized final answer)
