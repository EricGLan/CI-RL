# Notebooks

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks to explore and postprocess experiments.

A common pattern in these notebooks is to load an AML experiment defined by its URL, to download the outpus and/or metrics and to visualize them using matplotlib.

Install the required packages with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
